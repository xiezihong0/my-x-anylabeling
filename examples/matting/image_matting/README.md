**Image Matting** is the process of accurately estimating the foreground object in images and videos. It is a very important technique in image and video editing applications, particularly in film production for creating visual effects.

## Usage

1. Import your image (`Ctrl+I`) or video (`Ctrl+O`) file into the X-AnyLabeling.
2. Select and load the `RMBG v1.4 (BRIA AI)` model, or choose from other available matting models.
3. Initiate the process by clicking `Run (i)`. Once you've verified that everything is set up correctly, use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+M` to process all images in one go.

The output, once completed, will be automatically stored in a `x-anylabeling-matting` subdirectory within the same folder as your original image.
